# ~/.zsh_completion/_squeezy
#
# you will need to edit the list of commands above to match the pseudonyms you
# have for squeezy, if any;  a minimal confguration would be just:
#compdef squeezy
#
# to avoid having to fire up several processes (one of which being a big perl
# process) this completer caches the available options in $cache (see below)
