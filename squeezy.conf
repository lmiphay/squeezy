#  - the server defaults to localhost, if no value is specified here
#  - the port defaults to 9090, if no value is specified here

server   192.168.4.72

# authentication
#  - if username is unset here, then no authentication takes place
#  - if username is set here, then password must be set here too
#
#  if you don't use authentication on your server, then just remove (or
#  comment out) these two lines

# ###############################################
# players
#
# there are two formats for specifying players:
#  - player <PLAYER_NAME>
#  - player <GROUP_INDEX> <PLAYER_NAME>
#
# - if <GROUP_INDEX> is omitted, then group 0 is assumed
# - the first player in group 0 is the default player; so, if you don't
#   use groups at all, then that would be the first player listed here
# - <PLAYER_NAME> should be the human-readable name of your player, as
#   configured on your squeezeserver, and may not contain any whitespace
# - for each player, a new option is added to squeezy; for example,
#   with the configuration below, you can invoke:
#       squeezy -kitchen
#       squeezy -bedroom
# - at least one player must be in <GROUP_INDEX> 0 for squeezy to do anything
#   much useful at all
#

player Kitchen
player Living
player Bedroom
player 1 Nico
player 1 Chrissy

# also, if squeezy is executed from an executable whose names matches
# one of these players, than that player is used as the default
#
# configure some players and then try 'squeezy -printlinks'

# ###############################################
# the maginitude of small and large changes to volume levels:
# see -louder, -quieter, -Louder, -Quieter, -, +, --, ++
#

small_volume 4
large_volume 13

# ###############################################
# prefixes
#
# this is an oddity to handle file systems being mounted at different places on
# the client and the server; if you're running squeezy on the same host as the
# server then you can ignore (remove or comment out) these two lines
#
# whenever the '-play' and '-add' options are used, squeezy checks
# whether the thing to be played is a file or a directory
#
# if it is, then realpath is called, then squeezy premoves the prefix
# 'prefixpre' from the start of the path, and replaces it with 'prefixpos'
#
# so 'prefixpre' should be the path to the root of your music collection
# on the client, and 'prefixpos' should be the corresponding path on the
# server
#
# clear?
#
# either or both of these can be left empty; if provided, they should probably
# be absolute paths; they SHOULD NOT include trailling backslashes
#

prefixpre /mnt
prefixpos

# ###############################################
# shortcuts
#  - playlist/filename/directory name/url may not contain whitespace
#  - for each shortcut, a new option is added to squeezy; for example,
#    with the configuration below, you can invoke:
#       squeezy -dvb
#       squeezy -r4, etc.
#    to play the first shortcut, or the fifth
#  - "squeezy -default" plays the first shortcut
#
