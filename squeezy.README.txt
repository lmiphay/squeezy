Introduction:
   squeezy is a command-line wrapper around squeezeserver's telnet/CLI
   interface.  It can be used from the command line, in scripts or from
   cron.

Examples:
   squeezy -on
   squeezy -off
   squeezy -playlist
   squeezy -jump 2         # play the second song on the playlist
   squeezy -play .         # play all songs in the current directory
   squeezy -play <SOME_FILE>
   squeezy -play <SOME_URL>
   squeezy -next
   squeezy -previous
   squeezy -sleep 60
   squeezy -kitchen -volume 14
   squeezy -kitchen -volume +5
   squeezy -kitchen -<SOME_SHORTCUT>
   squeezy -button <SOME_BUTTON>
   squeezy -pause
   ... etc

   ("kitchen" and "bedroom" here would be the names of your players)

Why?
   - I've had my players since 2005 and the buttons on the remotes are
     packing up; I listen to squeezeboxes all the time, but with squeezy
     I rarely have to touch the remotes

   - the web interface is too slow

   - you're a geek, and you get things done faster at the keyboard

   - it's scriptable, and completion scripts are provided for
     interactive use (bash and zsh completion)

   - squeezy integrates well with desktop menuing systems or with cron;
     here are some cron examples:

     30 20 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -exit_if_playing -volume 22 -dvb
     00 23 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -volume -1
     30 23 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -volume -2
     00 00 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -volume -1
     30 00 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -volume -1
     00 01 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -volume -1
     30 02 * * * chronic squeezy -all -off
     30 06 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -exit_if_playing -volume 17 -dvb

     chronic is part of of the moreutils package
        - http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/moreutils/

      turn on the squeezebox in my bedroom a 8.30 playing my favourite
      radio station and at volume 22;  however, the -exit_if_playing
      options tells squeezy NOT to do this if the player happens already
      to be on

      from 11.00 onwards, the volume is gradually reduced and then at
      2.30 this (and all my other players) are turned off

      turn the player on again a 6.30 in the morning, but at a lower
      volume level; again, do this only if the player is not already on

      the '-dvb' is a shortcut in my configuration file; it plays my
      favourite radio station

   - another cron example:

     */8 1-6 * * * chronic squeezy -bedroom -exit_if_sleeping -sleep 30

     if I wake up and turn a player on during the night, it'll
     automatically go to sleep after about half an hour

   - and another cron example:

     30 05 * * sun chronic squeezy -all -die_if_playing || chronic SOME_COMMAND_TO_SET_THE_RADIO_STATION 

     I listen to various radio stations, but want a particular one
     playing in the morning; this changes to that station, but only if
     I'm not actually listening to any of my squeezeboxes already

     SOME_COMMAND_TO_SET_THE_RADIO_STATION is actually a command to set
     the tuner on my DVB card

Dependencies:
   - squeezy has been written and runs on FreeBSD and Ubuntu; it
     shouldn't be too hard to get it to work on other Unix and Unix-like
     systems (including Macs); but it may be more difficult to get it to
     work on other popular operating systems

   - squeezy uses the telnet/CLI interface of the squeezebox server;
     this hasn't changed significantly in many years, so it should work
     with pretty much any server more recent than about five years old

   - squeezy is written in "perl", any reasonably-recent perl version
     should do

   - Non-software:
     if you haven't done so already, then use your squeezeserver's web
     interface to give your players suitable human-readable names (such
     as "Kitchen", or "Bedroom"); these names must not contain
     whitespace characters.

Installation:
   1. put the file "squeezy" into some suitable place (such as
      ~/bin/, /usr/local/bin/, or /usr/bin/) and make it executable

   2. edit "squeezy.conf" to match your own setup.  You MUST do this;
      squeezy will not do much without a suitable configuration file

   3. install "squeezy.conf" in some suitable location;  squeezy looks
      for its configuration file in the following locations:

	   ./squeezy.conf
	   $HOME/.squeezy.conf
	   $HOME/.config/squeezy/squeezy.conf
	   $HOME/.config/squeezy.conf
	   /usr/local/etc/squeezy.conf
	   /etc/squeezy.conf
   
      it chooses the first (readable) file it finds.

Usage:
   try "squeezy -help"; "squeezy -otions" might be helpful too

Tips:
   -  try "squeezy -print_links"; this outputs a list of commands to
      install an alias for squeezy for each of your players; for example,
      for me its output is:

	 ln -vf /usr/local/bin/squeezy /usr/local/bin/kitchen
	 ln -vf /usr/local/bin/squeezy /usr/local/bin/living
	 ln -vf /usr/local/bin/squeezy /usr/local/bin/bedroom
	 ln -vf /usr/local/bin/squeezy /usr/local/bin/nico
	 ln -vf /usr/local/bin/squeezy /usr/local/bin/chrissy

   then use:

      squeezy -print-links | sudo sh

   to install the links (you may need 'sudo')

   WARNING: make sure your player names do not clash with existing command names
   before doing this

   you can then do things like:

      kitchen -off
      bedroom -volume 12

   where 'kitchen' and 'bedroom' are the names of your players.

   -  take a look at 'chronic' from the moreutils package, it helps
      when writing nice clean crontab files

      also, the -exit_if_playing option is particularly useful in
      crontab files

   -  files are included in the distribution for TAB-completion in both
      zsh and bash
